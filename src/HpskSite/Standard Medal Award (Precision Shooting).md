BR-PS.3.1 Criterion A: Silver (Percentage)
IF a shooter ranks within the best one-ninth (1/9) of participants in the relevant weapon group/class, THEN award a Silver Standard Medal. Calculation shall always be rounded down to the nearest whole number.

BR-PS.3.2 Criterion A: Bronze (Percentage)
IF a shooter ranks within the best one-third (1/3) of participants in the relevant weapon group/class, THEN award a Bronze Standard Medal. Calculation shall always be rounded down to the nearest whole number.

BR-PS.3.3 Tie Rule (Percentage)
Shooters who achieve the exact same total score as the last eligible shooter under BR-PS.3.1 or BR-PS.3.2 are also entitled to the medal.

BR-PS.3.4 Criterion B: Fixed Score
IF a shooter achieves a score equal to or greater than the fixed point requirement (see table below), THEN award the corresponding medal.

BR-PS.3.5 Variable Series Calculation
IF more than 10 series are shot, THEN the score requirement for that medal must be calculated by dividing the 10-series requirement by 10 and multiplying by the number of series shot.
