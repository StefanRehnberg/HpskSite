We have previously refactored our project structure and name space according to this document: COMPETITION_TYPES_ARCHITECTURE.md
This was primalilly done to create a structure where we can isolate code for different competition types that have very different ways of creating start-lists, entering results, calculating result lists and using finals. So far we only have code for the competiton type "Precision".
The types are represented by c# classes in the file HpskSite.Models.CompetitionType and HpskSite.Models.CompetitionTypes. As of now we have several types: Precision, Milsnabb, Duell, Nationell_Helmatch, Faltskytte, Faltskytte_Norsk and Springskytte. Several of these (Milsnabb, Duell and Nationell_Helmatch) uses the exact same ways of creating start-lists and entering results as the Precision type does, but they use a slightly different way of calculating and presenting results.
The competition types Faltskytte and Faltskytte_Norsk, have completely different start lists, results entering and results and final list and absolutely warrants it's own code base in the name space HpskSite.CompetitionTypes.FieldShooting eventually. The same goes for Springskytte, it is also unique and should eventually have it's own name space in HpskSite.CompetitionTypes.Springskytte.
Is this the best architecture? Should we have unique name spaces for all of the different competition types even if they partially work in the same way, for instance uses the same way of calculating and presenting start lists? Or should we use a different or complimentary architecture to reuse or inherit some code? Should we create different types of services or calculators for different parts of what makes up a specific competition type, like startlist calculator and results calculator? if so, how many would we need and what types..?
