Database: Local DB, Umbraco
We use Umbraco first principle to manage documents in Umbraco backoffice.
I make the Document Types and there properties from instructions that you provide.
You write the code but always asks me first before starting to implement.
If I ask a question, you answer the question first, before starting any code implementations.
When implementing new features, allways break them down into small testable blocks and test each block before moving on to the next block.
Never assume, find out the fact!
When debugging, trace the code, check that functions actually do what they imply, don't assume they do!
Run and test code yourself whenever possible, write logs to temp files for you to read if needed.
Allways do a Lint-Check after a code change.
